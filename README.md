# Infinite PDF Theorem

> The [infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a
> typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any
> given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the
> monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number
> of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the entire observable
> universe would type a single complete work, such as Shakespeare's Hamlet, is
> so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of
> thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is
> extremely low (but technically not zero). The theorem can be generalized to
> state that any sequence of events which has a non-zero probability of
> happening, at least as long as it hasn't occurred, will almost certainly
> eventually occur.
